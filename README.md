# public-containers

Projects that were either container-less or that I wanted to produce my own container builds of for whatever reason (typically to get more up-to-date base images).  Every subfolder is a project and they push to `jeffcasavant/<subfolder>` nightly and whenever I update `master` in this repo.  Pushes will update `latest` and also be tagged as `<application git checkout version>-<build datetime in YYYYMMDDTHHMMSS>`.
