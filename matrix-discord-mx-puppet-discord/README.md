# [mx-puppet-discord](https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord.git)

You will need to inject the following files:


* /app/config.yaml (duplicate and customize [the project's example config](https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord/blob/master/sample.config.yaml))
* /app/discord-registration.yaml (probably best to have the app generate it - see the [project's README](https://github.com/matrix-discord/mx-puppet-discord#setup))
