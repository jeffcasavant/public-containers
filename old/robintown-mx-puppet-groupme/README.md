# [mx-puppet-groupme](https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme)

You will need to inject the following files:

* /app/config.yaml (duplicate and customize [the project's example config](https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme/-/blob/main/sample.config.yaml))
* /app/groupme-registration.yaml (probably best to have the app generate it - see the [project's README](https://gitlab.com/robintown/mx-puppet-groupme/-/tree/main#setup))
